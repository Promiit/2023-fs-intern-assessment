# 2023 Full Stack Developer Intern Assessment

As an end user, I want to be able to view a list of funds so that I can have a better understanding of the available funds. I want to be able to filter the funds based on their location field and see the updated list in real time.

Acceptance Criteria:

-A React application is created

-The application loads the fund and location information from http://localhost:5000/funds

-The funds are displayed as a list on the application

-A filter option is provided to filter the funds based on location field

-The filter updates the list in real time based on the selected location
